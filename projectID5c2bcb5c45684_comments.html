<HTML><BODY>This 1923 guidebook of the Philippines gives a general overview of its history, numerous pictures from the early 1920's (and earlier), and a load of practical information for the traveler (at that time; since Manila was heavily damaged in WW2, a lot of the buildings pictured no longer exist.)

<p>A few pages appear cut on the edge, this is due to the way the pages where scanned; in all cases, it should be possible to make out what the text is, although on one or two pages a detour to the original scans (<a href="https://archive.org/details/raha_103101/">here</a>) may be required. 

<p>Please treat the "cut-in headings" as side-notes.

<p>At the end of the volume are a number of large tables.

<p>A few index pages are damaged. Please don't mark them as bad. Do what you can, and I will fix them during PP-ing.

<p>Have Fun!
